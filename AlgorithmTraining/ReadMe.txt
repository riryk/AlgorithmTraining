========================================================================

AppWizard has created this AlgorithmTraining Application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your AlgorithmTraining application.

AlgorithmTraining.vcproj

 One month ago during DR on prod IAN did not place an order.
 I looked at splunk logs and saw it was due to the nack: 

 <NAck>    
    <CompletionTime>2019-03-23T12:39:02.075Z</CompletionTime>    
    <ErrorCode>SYSTEM_ERROR</ErrorCode>    
    <ErrorMessage>Failed to send message to kafka service. Topic: inbound-messages; Key: 1eef49e8-64c5-4945- b617-ac68e0484ff0</ErrorMessage>
 </NAck>

 What does this error mean. Does it mean that IN is not available? 
 Thanks
